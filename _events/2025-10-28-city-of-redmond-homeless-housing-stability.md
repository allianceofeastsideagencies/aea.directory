The City of Redmond, in partnership with other Eastside cities and nonprofits, works to ensure that those living unsheltered will have access to services that will support their path to stability. Homelessness is a complex issue which requires the City to bring a compassionate, tailored, and comprehensive set of solutions to address the unique needs of each person. The City of Homeless Program Administrator and Program Coordinator have office hours at Together Center on Tuesday each week from 1-3pm.Â  The program team provides ID assistance, agency referrals, shelter assistance (Men, Women, Families), safe parking referrals , and much more. 
Tuesdays at 1-3pm

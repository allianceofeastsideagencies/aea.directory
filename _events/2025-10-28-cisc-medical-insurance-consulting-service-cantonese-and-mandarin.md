Person-Centered Support
Access to affordable healthcare provides peace of mind. Our Healthcare Access Team is dedicated to providing person-centered assistance to enable clients to make informed decisions about their healthcare coverage. Our team empowers community members through workshops, information and assistance, and outreach. 
Benefits Enrollment Center (BEC)
We operate the first regional BEC in the state of Washington that is funded by the National Council on Aging. Along with our partners, we provide person-centered assistance to low-income seniors and persons with disabilities in accessing benefits for which they may be eligible, such as Medicare, Medicaid, Low-income Subsidy, Medicare Savings Programs, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, utility discount, and prescription drug assistance programs.

CISC offers linguistically and culturally appropriate support for immigrants and refugees—family and youth programs, senior services, translations, referrals, and advocacy. By extending access and equity in human-services on the Eastside, they bolster AEA’s mission of a strong voice for health & human services and a connected network of providers.

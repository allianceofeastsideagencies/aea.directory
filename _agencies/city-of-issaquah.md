Issaquah’s community-services arms coordinate local efforts in homeless prevention, aging services, family support, and youth programming. Their municipal involvement strengthens the Eastside human-services network and enables collaborative responses to community needs—key aspects of AEA’s mission to research needs and bring organizations together.

KidVantage supplies essential goods (diapers, clothing, school supplies) and supports children in economic insecurity by partnering with schools, food banks, and nonprofits across five counties. Their high-touch service and network-partner model align with AEAâ€™s emphasis on organizational collaboration and providing all-ages support in a strong human-services network.

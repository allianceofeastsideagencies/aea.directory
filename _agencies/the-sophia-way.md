Sophia Way offers housing and critical services to women experiencing homelessness, along with case-management, outreach, and support to re-establish stability. Their preventive and supportive role addresses a major service gap (homelessness) in the Eastside, aligning directly with AEAâ€™s mission of building healthy communities through a strong human-services network.
